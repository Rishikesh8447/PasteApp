# PasteApp 📝

PasteApp is my **first React project** — a simple and modern paste-sharing web application built to practice React fundamentals, CRUD operations, and real-world deployment.

The app allows users to create, search, edit, and delete text or code pastes with a clean and professional dark UI.
